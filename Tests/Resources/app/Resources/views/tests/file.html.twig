<h2>Upload file</h2>
<h4>Standard upload</h4>
<p>The upload is handled by your own controller action. The UploadFileHelper is used to handle the upload and creates a
    FileInterface object, writing the object to storage has to be implemented by yourself.</p>
{{ form(upload_form, { attr: { class: 'standard' } }) }}
<h4>Web editor upload (default)</h4>
<p>The upload is completely handled by the FileController::uploadAction. The UploadFileHelper will process the upload,
    writes the created FileInterface object to storage and returns a response that depends on the editor defined in the
    request.</p>
{{ form(editor_form, { attr: { class: 'editor default' } }) }}

<h2>Download file(s)</h2>
{% if files is empty %}
    <p>No files found, upload a file first.</p>
{% else %}
    <ul class="downloads">
        {% for file in files %}
        <li><a href="{{ cmf_media_download_url(file) }}" title="Download {{ file.name }}">Download {{ file.name }}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
